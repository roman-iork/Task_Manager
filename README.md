Ready to use Task Manager.
It has for your service next functionality:
- adding users and assigning them to tasks;
- creating tasks;
- assigning statuses to tasks. Statuses are also creatable;
- marking tasks with lables. Labels also can be created.

By default there are 5 (draft, published, to_be_fixed, to_publish, to_review) statuses and 2 (bug, feature) labels ready for you.

To see app working go to [link](https://task-manager-p7ec.onrender.com) and authenticate by hexlet@example.com with password **qwerty**.

If you want to use code after cloning you'll need to supply it with key pair (required) for security purposes and dsn name (optional) for *Sentry* service that informs on exceptions.
